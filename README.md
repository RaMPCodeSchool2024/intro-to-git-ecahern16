# git-intro
An introduction to version control with git.

Instructions:
1. Edit the mystery_script.sh so that it prints "My name is __", with your name ;), after "Hello World". 
2. Edit the mystery_script.sh so that it asks the user for an input integer and prints out every even integer from 1 to the input integer (inclusive).
3. Run the script to confirm it does what you expect.
4. Add your changes, commit them, then push to the GitHub Classroom repository.

Hello World!
My name is Erin :)
